                description doesn't fit it will get cut off. To see the full description, the user will have to
                click the ad which will redirect them to the full version of the ad on it's own page. There,
                additional info will also be shown, like more pictures uploaded by the poster as well as the
                comments visitors have left on the ad. The poster can comment as well.</p>
