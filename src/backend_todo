After post publish redirect to the POST

before create user, check if user with this username or password already
exists. Do the check in controller and return special exception and handle it
properly

When request body attributes not set correctly, catch exception and
return fail response. Now it throws exception.

Fix get user by id when it doesnt exist to fail. Same for products. Systematic mistake

Default product state when created. Default user role when created.

Fix when no id specified for GET/DELETE.

After successful comment adding, return the newly created comment to
the website.
