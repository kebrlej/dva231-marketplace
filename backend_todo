REST API
//basic example
- request routing
- error handling and exceptions
- access rights for resources
- response format


CONTROLLERS
- write obvious use cases
- implement basic functionality without database


DATABASE
- query builder, default query methods for each table


NICE TO HAVE:
- security, nice urls
- resolve proper http methods and error codes (dont bother about it now)
